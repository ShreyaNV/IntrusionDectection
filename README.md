This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect potentially malicious activities within a network. 
The system uses machine learning techniques to classify network traffic as either benign or intrusive, enabling real-time alerts for network security.

This model detects when intruder enters into an restricted area . In this I have used background subtraction .
I have used python to construct this model and libraries such as openCV to view and detect the intruder in the
given video and numpy to do basic operations.

Technologies Used : 
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
Jupyter Notebook
